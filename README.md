# Thecore component
## Whys
As a freelance full-stack developer I always needed smart tools and methods to manage scalable projects. During the years I started to make choices, studying languages, patterns and technologies that were getting my attention because of their smartness.

Here is the efforts-turned-code, used and tested in different professional projects; thecore is just one of the  components, the most important, the foundation on which all the other atomic components grow. On github I'll put all of them, or, at least the general ones, the ones which doesn't have a strong characterization on a process peculiar to one of my customers.
## Philosphy
I always preferred to invest some more time in finding the best tool for what I need and compile a toolbox of helpful technologies, rather than start coding mindlessly. Thecore has grown and proved to be a time saver, it surely could be enhanced and as long as I keep using it for my day by day job, it will grow more, but if you feel that RoR, sane defaults, atomic engines (components) sound good to you, don't be scared to pull and make Thecore even more useful.
## Wiki
In the [wiki](https://github.com/gabrieletassoni/thecore/wiki) I'll put all the useful articles needed to fully understand the tool and the background theory.
