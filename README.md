# Thecore  

**Thecore** is a framework built on the idea of _ATOMS_—modular **Atomic Components** that empower you to create scalable, maintainable web applications. At its core, your Ruby on Rails (RoR) app becomes a lightweight wrapper, depending only on the _Atomic Components_ you truly need.

With **Thecore**, you stop worrying about _how_ to build your app and focus on _what_ to build.  

**Wouldn’t you rather focus on your ideas than reinventing the wheel?**

## What Are ATOMS?  

ATOMS are the building blocks of **Thecore**, designed with these principles:  

### 1. **Self-Contained Engines**  
Each _Atomic Component_ is an isolated Rails engine, developed with clear guidelines outlined in this repository.  

### 2. **Pluggable Components**  
Need a specific feature? Add the corresponding _Atomic Component_ to your app’s dependencies.  
Don’t need it anymore? Simply remove it from the `Gemfile` or `gemspec`, and your app will keep running smoothly—without breaking existing business logic.  

### 3. **Tested, Reusable Components**  
Every _Atomic Component_ is rigorously tested. Once verified in one app, it’s reliable in all others, reducing regression testing overhead.  

### 4. **Easily Extensible**  
Enhance _Atomic Components_ with additional functionality or extend them by building new components that depend on the originals. No need to touch established, stable code.

## Why **Thecore** Exists  

As a freelance full-stack developer, I’ve always sought smarter ways to manage scalable projects. Over the years, I’ve refined my approach by studying languages, patterns, and technologies that prioritize efficiency and scalability.  

**Thecore** is the culmination of these efforts—a framework born from real-world projects. It has consistently proven its value, helping me handle projects that might seem overwhelming for a solo developer.  

At its heart, **Thecore** provides a foundation where every other _Atomic Component_ grows. Many of these components are shared on GitHub, particularly those that aren’t tied to a specific client’s needs.

## The Philosophy Behind **Thecore**  

I believe in investing time to find the right tools and building a reliable toolbox, rather than diving headfirst into coding without a plan.  

**Thecore** is the result of that philosophy. It saves time, scales effortlessly, and evolves as I use it in my day-to-day work.  

If RoR, sane defaults, and modular engines sound appealing to you, don’t hesitate to explore and contribute. **Thecore** is designed to grow through collaboration.
