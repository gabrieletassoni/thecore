# Best Practices

Here will be documented all the current best practice that must be followed to create a **Thecore** Application but even a new _ATOM_ in the form of Ruby Gems to encapsulate your business logic in a more reusable way.

Obviously all of these steps are skippable, but adopting all of them gives the best performance:

1. Setup [VS Code Dev Containers](01_SETUP_VSCODE.md) as a powerful way to write portable code.
2. Step by Step: [Create a new Thecore Application](02_CREATE_AN_APP.md)
3. Step by Step: [Create a new Thecore ATOM](03_CREATE_AN_ATOM.md)
4. List of all the [Conventions](99_CONVENTIONS.md) which are active part of the **Thecore** Experience.
5. [REST API](04_REST_API.md) using [Model Drive API](https://github.com/gabrieletassoni/model_driven_api/tree/release/3) ATOM.
