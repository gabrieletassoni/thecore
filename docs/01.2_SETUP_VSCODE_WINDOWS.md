## Walkthrough: Setting Up Visual Studio Code with DevContainers on a Windows 11 Computer Using WSL (No Docker Desktop)

This guide walks you through the steps of setting up Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with DevContainers on a Windows 11 system using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), without Docker Desktop. We'll install WSL with the latest Ubuntu, set up Docker inside WSL, configure SSH-agent for sharing SSH keys, generate SSH keys for GitLab/GitHub, and finally, create a Node.js DevContainer to test the environment.
From my experience, opting for Docker inside WSL rather than using Docker Desktop can offer a significant performance boost, especially in terms of speed and system resource efficiency. Docker Desktop adds a layer of complexity with its virtualization and interaction between Windows and Docker containers, which can introduce overhead. By using Docker directly within WSL, you eliminate this extra layer, allowing Docker to run natively in the Linux environment, which tends to be faster and more lightweight. This can lead to quicker container startup times, lower memory usage, and better overall performance for development tasks. While Docker Desktop has a lot of user-friendly features, if performance and direct control over the environment are key priorities, using WSL directly may be the more efficient choice. However, it's important to note that this experience can vary depending on specific use cases and system configurations.

### Step 1: Install WSL and Ubuntu on Windows 11

WSL allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows. Follow these steps to install WSL and set up Ubuntu.

1. **Enable WSL Feature on Windows:**
   - Open **PowerShell** as Administrator and run the following command:
     ```powershell
     wsl --install
     ```
     This will install WSL, download the latest Linux kernel, and set Ubuntu as your default distribution.

### Step 2: Install Docker in WSL (Without Docker Desktop)

To run Docker inside your WSL instance, you need to install Docker directly within Ubuntu.

1. **Install Docker Dependencies in WSL:**
   - Open the **Ubuntu** terminal (WSL) and update package lists:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
     ```
   
2. **Add Docker’s Official GPG Key and Repository:**
   - Download Docker's official GPG key:
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/docker.asc
     ```
   - Add Docker's repository:
     ```bash
     sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
     ```

3. **Install Docker:**
   - Update package lists again and install Docker:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
     ```

4. **Start Docker:**
   - Start the Docker service:
     ```bash
     sudo service docker start
     ```

5. **Enable Docker to Start on Boot:**
   - Enable Docker to start automatically:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable docker
     ```

6. **Verify Docker Installation:**
   - Run the following to verify Docker is installed correctly:
     ```bash
     sudo docker --version
     sudo docker run hello-world
     ```
   This should download and run a test container to ensure Docker is working.

### Step 3: Install and Set Up SSH-Agent to Share SSH Keys with DevContainers

To work with Git repositories (like GitLab or GitHub) in your DevContainer, you need to ensure that your SSH keys are available inside the WSL environment.

1. **Install OpenSSH Client in Ubuntu (WSL):**
   - Install the OpenSSH client package if it's not already installed:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install openssh-client
     ```

2. **Start the SSH-Agent:**
   - Start the SSH agent to manage your keys:
     ```bash
     eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
     ```

3. **Add Your SSH Key to the Agent:**
   - If you already have an SSH key, you can add it to the agent:
     ```bash
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     ```
   - If you don’t have an SSH key, generate a new one.

4. **Generate an SSH Key (if you don’t have one yet):**
   - Run the following to generate a new SSH key (e.g., for GitHub or GitLab):
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```
     Follow the prompts to specify the file location and passphrase.
   - After generating the key, add it to the SSH agent:
     ```bash
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     ```

5. **Copy the SSH Key to GitLab/GitHub:**
   - Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```
   - Log in to your GitHub or GitLab account, navigate to the SSH keys settings, and add your SSH public key.

### Step 4: Install Visual Studio Code on Windows

1. **Download Visual Studio Code:**
   - Go to the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and download the installer for Windows.

2. **Install VS Code:**
   - Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

3. **Install the Remote - WSL Extension in VS Code:**
   - Open VS Code, navigate to the **Extensions** view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), and search for **Remote - WSL**.
   - Click **Install** to install the extension.

### Step 5: Connect VS Code to WSL

1. **Open VS Code from WSL:**
   - Launch your Ubuntu terminal (WSL), and run:
     ```bash
     code .
     ```
   - This command will open the current directory in VS Code, but it will connect to the WSL environment.

2. **Verify WSL Connection:**
   - In VS Code, you should now see “WSL: Ubuntu” in the bottom-left corner of the window, confirming that you are connected to your Ubuntu distribution.

### Step 6: Create a Node.js DevContainer

Now, let’s create a Node.js DevContainer to ensure everything is working.

1. **Create a Project Folder:**
   - In the Ubuntu terminal, create a new directory for your project:
     ```bash
     mkdir my-node-devcontainer
     cd my-node-devcontainer
     ```

2. **Create a `devcontainer.json` File:**
   - In VS Code (connected to WSL), create a new file at `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Node.js DevContainer",
       "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:latest",
       "features": {
         "git": "latest"
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Add a Simple Node.js App (Optional):**
   - Create a `server.js` file with the following content:
     ```javascript
     const http = require('http');

     const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
       res.write('Hello from DevContainer!');
       res.end();
     });

     server.listen(3000, () => {
       console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
     });
     ```

4. **Rebuild the DevContainer:**
   - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search for **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container**.
   - VS Code will rebuild and open the container using the configuration defined in `devcontainer.json`.

5. **Test the Setup:**
   - Once the DevContainer is built and running, open the integrated terminal inside VS Code (`Ctrl+``) and run the following to start your Node.js server:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```
   - Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see "Hello from DevContainer!".
