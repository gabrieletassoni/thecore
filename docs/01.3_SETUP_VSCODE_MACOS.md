## Walkthrough: Setting Up Visual Studio Code with DevContainers on macOS (Latest Version)

This guide walks you through installing and setting up **Visual Studio Code** on macOS to work with **DevContainers** at a similar level of performance and usability as described in the previous setups for Windows 11 and Ubuntu 24. We'll cover installing VS Code, setting up Docker, configuring SSH keys for Git, and creating a Node.js DevContainer for testing.

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code on macOS

1. **Download Visual Studio Code:**
   - Go to the official [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
   - Select **macOS** and download the `.dmg` file.

2. **Install Visual Studio Code:**
   - Open the `.dmg` file after downloading, then drag the **Visual Studio Code** icon to the **Applications** folder.

3. **Launch Visual Studio Code:**
   - Open **Visual Studio Code** from your **Applications** folder or by using **Spotlight** (`Cmd+Space`, then search for "Visual Studio Code").

4. **Install the Remote - Containers Extension:**
   - In **VS Code**, open the **Extensions** view (`Cmd+Shift+X`).
   - Search for **Remote - Containers** and click **Install** to install the extension.

### Step 2: Install Docker on macOS

1. **Download Docker Desktop for macOS:**
   - Go to the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download **Docker Desktop for macOS**.

2. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   - Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag **Docker** to the **Applications** folder.
   - Launch Docker from the **Applications** folder.

3. **Start Docker:**
   - When Docker starts, you'll see the Docker whale icon in the menu bar at the top-right of your screen. Wait for it to show **Docker is running**.

4. **Configure Docker to Start on Boot (Optional):**
   - By default, Docker starts when your Mac starts. If this is not the case, you can configure it through Docker’s **Preferences** menu.

5. **Verify Docker Installation:**
   - Open **Terminal** and run:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     docker run hello-world
     ```
   If Docker is installed correctly, it will download the "hello-world" test image and run it, displaying a success message.

### Step 3: Set Up SSH Keys for Git Operations

1. **Install OpenSSH (If Not Already Installed):**
   - macOS typically comes with OpenSSH pre-installed. You can check if it’s available by running:
     ```bash
     ssh -v
     ```

2. **Generate a New SSH Key (if you don’t have one):**
   - If you don’t already have an SSH key pair, you can generate one by running:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```
     Follow the prompts to choose the file location and set a passphrase (optional).

3. **Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent:**
   - Start the SSH agent:
     ```bash
     eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
     ```
   - Add the SSH private key to the agent:
     ```bash
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     ```

4. **Add SSH Key to GitHub/GitLab:**
   - Copy your SSH public key to the clipboard:
     ```bash
     pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```
   - Log in to your **GitHub** or **GitLab** account, go to **Settings**, navigate to **SSH and GPG keys**, and paste the copied key.

### Step 4: Configure Docker in Visual Studio Code

1. **Install the Docker Extension in VS Code:**
   - Open **VS Code**, go to the **Extensions** view (`Cmd+Shift+X`), search for **Docker**, and install it. This will enable you to interact with Docker containers directly from within VS Code.

2. **Verify Docker Integration:**
   - After installing the Docker extension, you should see a **Docker** icon in the Activity Bar on the left side of the VS Code window.
   - Ensure Docker is running by checking if the containers and images are visible in the **Docker** tab.

### Step 5: Create a Node.js DevContainer

Let’s now create a Node.js DevContainer to ensure everything is working and running smoothly.

1. **Create a Project Folder:**
   - Open **Terminal** and create a new project folder for your Node.js project:
     ```bash
     mkdir my-node-devcontainer
     cd my-node-devcontainer
     ```

2. **Create the DevContainer Configuration File:**
   - Open **VS Code** in the `my-node-devcontainer` directory (`code .`), and create a `.devcontainer` folder inside the project.
   - Inside the `.devcontainer` folder, create a file named `devcontainer.json` with the following content:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Node.js DevContainer",
       "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:latest",
       "features": {
         "git": "latest"
       }
     }
     ```

3. **(Optional) Add a Simple Node.js App:**
   - In **VS Code**, create a `server.js` file in the root of your project folder with the following content:
     ```javascript
     const http = require('http');

     const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
       res.write('Hello from DevContainer!');
       res.end();
     });

     server.listen(3000, () => {
       console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
     });
     ```

4. **Rebuild and Open the DevContainer:**
   - In **VS Code**, open the **Command Palette** (`Cmd+Shift+P`), search for **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container**, and select it.
   - VS Code will automatically build the DevContainer based on the configuration in the `devcontainer.json` file. It will then reopen your project inside the container.

5. **Test the Setup:**
   - Once inside the DevContainer, open the integrated terminal (`Ctrl+` backtick) and run:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the message "Hello from DevContainer!".

### Conclusion

You have successfully set up **Visual Studio Code** and **Docker** on **macOS** to work with DevContainers, replicating a similar development experience as on Windows 11 and Ubuntu. By installing the necessary tools, configuring Docker and SSH keys, and creating a simple Node.js DevContainer, you now have a powerful, reproducible development environment that works seamlessly within containers. This setup allows for consistent environments, quick project setup, and efficient collaboration across teams.
