    # One might assume that using postgres:15 as their tag would accomplish soft-pinning to avoid breaking changes. However, what occurred in the past few days was that 15 moved from 15-bullseye to 15-bookworm. This creates a breaking change because postgres does not provide its own collations -- it uses collations from the base OS, which were upgraded with Debian's change from bullseye to bookworm.
    # The takeaway is that if you actually want soft-pinning without breaking changes, you need to pin not only the postgres major version, but also the operating system, i.e. postgres:15-bookworm.
